## F Test to Compare Two Variances

<br>

### Purpose

Make inference on two population variances. 

<br>

### Assumptions

1. The samples are independent.
2. The distributions of the two populations are approximately normal. 

<br>

### Mathematics

$$ F = \frac{s_{max}^2}{s_{min}^2}$$

<br>

where

$$ \frac{df_{numer}}{df_{denom}} $$

<br>

Notes: Always a one tailed test using the F distribution. Can be understood as between group variability divided by within group variability. Also the basis of ANOVA. 

<br>


### Code

```{r}
var.test(iris$Sepal.Width, iris$Petal.Width)
```
