### Assumptions

2. The observations are paired. 
2. The distribution of the differences is normal or of such size that CLM is applicable. 

<br> 

### Mathematical Model

$$ t = \frac{\bar{d} - \delta_o}{\sqrt{s_d^2 / n}}$$

where:

$s_d$ is the estimated variance of the differences


<br> 

### Notes

If the alternative hypothesis is $\mu_1 > \mu_2$ use alternative = 'greater'. 


<br> 

### Code

```{r}
t.test(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Petal.Length,
       alternative = 'two.sided',
       var.equal = T,
       paired = F)
```
